# Whole-genome-duplication


Pipelies for genome analysis of *Schizothorax o’connori*, a endemic fish in Tibet; 
Schizothoracinae (order Cypriniformes, family Cyprinidae) is an important subfamily of endemic fish on the QTP.Whole-genome duplications (WGDs) of Schizothoracinae are believed to have played a significant role in speciation and environmental adaptation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Here, we present the tetraploid genome of Schizothorax o’connori, which underwent a recent WGD later than ~1.23 Ma. 

  ![*S o’connori*](https://github.com/DingDingFan/whole-genome-duplication/blob/master/LASTZ_alignment_visualize/lastz.github.log.svg) 



It contains 4 part:


  ## 1  WGD_subgenome_split

    Split the sub-genome generated by WGD.

  ## 2  Ohnolog

    Detect Ohnolog genes generated by WGD.

  ## 3 Gene_Lost

    Desinged to find singleon genes after WGD.

  ## 4 LASTZ_alignment_visualize

    LASTZ aligment visualization with genes structure and repeat element !
